This challenge is about developing a Book Store app. 

Our users need to be able to see what are our available books and for this we are building an app.

Our backend has already been developed, and consists of three endpoints:
	/books: return a list of all Books.
	/best_sellers: return a list of the ISBN codes of our best seller books.
	/recent_books: return a list of the ISBN codes fo our new books added to the store.

You need to develop these screens
    - Home (List of all books)
    - Book details
    - App configuration (Optional)

Home Screen
    Display all books in separate sections using a UICollectionView. 
    Each section should display the Genre name (History, Science or Business).
	Each book item should display: Book cover image, Book title, Book author.

        - The first section should be all our best seller books
        - Second section: History books
        - Third section: Science books
        - Fourth section: Business books

		- Horizontal Scroll for Best Sellers section (Optional)
			- Make the Best Sellers section scroll horizontally.

		- Book Filtering (Optional)
            - The UI should have a filter button
            - When tapping, it should display a new screen as a modal
            - The user should filter books by Recent and Genre
			- When displaying filtering results you should display all books in a single section.

Book Details screen
    When tapping a book in the Home screen, the user should be redirected to a details screen.
    This screen should display:

        - Book picture
        - Book title
        - Author name
        - Book description
		- Show a badge in the UI if the book is a best seller.

App Configuration screen (Optional)
    The app configuration screen should display one setting option: Disable/Enable displaying imported books. The default value should be Enabled.
    - After changing this configuration, the app should reload the Home and reflect the change.
	- This setting should be persistent between app launches.
